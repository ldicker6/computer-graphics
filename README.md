# Image Processing Toolkit (C++)

## Overview
This project implements a **mini Photoshop/GIMP** in C++, supporting a wide range of filters and transformations.  
From simple brightness adjustments to advanced morphing, the program demonstrates **computer graphics algorithms**, **linear algebra in practice**, and **systems-level programming in C++**.  

I developed this project as part of JHU‚Äôs Computer Graphics course, but I approached it as if I were building a standalone image library.

## Features
- **Core Filters**
  - Brightness / Contrast adjustment
  - Luminance (grayscale)
  - Saturation changes
  - Additive noise injection
  - Cropping & quantization  

- **Dithering & Sampling**
  - Random dithering
  - Ordered dithering (2√ó2)
  - Floyd‚ÄìSteinberg error diffusion
  - Nearest / Bilinear / Gaussian sampling  

- **Geometric Transforms**
  - Scaling (nearest, bilinear, Gaussian)
  - Rotation (nearest, bilinear, Gaussian)  

- **Advanced Effects**
  - Edge detection (3√ó3 kernels)
  - Gaussian blur
  - Fun warp filters (fisheye, swirl, bulge)
  - Beier‚ÄìNeely morphing (feature-based image metamorphosis)

## Technical Highlights
- Implemented in **C++** with manual memory management for pixel buffers  
- Built with **Makefiles** for Unix-like systems  
- Designed a **modular filter pipeline** with composable operations  
- Applied:
  - **Barycentric coordinates** for interpolation  
  - **Affine transformations** for geometric warping  
  - **Gaussian kernels** for smoothing and sampling

## Usage
To see available filters:
```bash
./Assignment1
```
Example 1: Brighten by 10%
```
./Assignment1 --brighten 1.1 --in input.bmp --out output.bmp
```

Example 2: Grayscale + Edge Detection
```
./Assignment1 --luminance 1 --edgeDetect3x3 1 --in input.jpg --out edges.jpg
```

Example 3: Rotate with Bilinear Sampling
```
./Assignment1 --rotateBilinear 45 --in input.bmp --out rotated.bmp
```

### Morphing Demo (Michael Jackson Inspiration)

This project implements **Beier‚ÄìNeely morphing**, the classic line-segment‚Äìbased algorithm behind Michael Jackson‚Äôs *Black or White* (1991) music video- one of the first landmark uses of digital morphing in entertainment. I recreated the effect by smoothly transforming a portrait of a girl into a portrait of a boy, demonstrating warping, cross-dissolving, and practical graphics pipeline design.
